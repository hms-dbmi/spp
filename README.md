# ChIP-seq processing pipeline
An [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package for analysis of ChIP-seq and other functional sequencing data.
Please see [package homepage](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/ChIP-seq/) for details.

## Requirements
A unix-flavored OS with R (>= 3.3.0) installed.

## Installation
Since version 1.15.4 spp is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spp) and can be installed using the command

```
install.packages("spp", dependencies=TRUE)
```




Alternatively you can use modtools to install spp:

```
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github('hms-dbmi/spp', build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

Or 

download a .tar.gz containing the [latest release](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/spp/releases) and use the standard R installation command, e.g.:
```
R CMD INSTALL spp_1.13.tar.gz
```

Note: Since version 1.15.4 the Boost headers are incorporated and linked taking advantage of [BH package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BH) to avoid problems due to non-standard Boost libraries installation.
